# AutoRecorder

## To Start
The way to use the AutoRecorder is similar to that of RISCV-Console. 

1. change directory to ```/autorecorder/```, and run ```./rvconsole.sh``` in command line (```rvconsole.sh``` is the same as RISCV Console, and AutoRunner).
2. in command line, do ```make``` .
3. change directory to ```/bin/``` and run ```./autorecorder -d```, with flag ```-d``` to open debug mode.
4. After inserting Firmware, press down button ```Record``` first, to enable recording function, then enable ```Run``` button, then insert Cartridge. (Might be fixed in future version).
5. To finish recording, press button ```Record``` again. You can customize the file name and directory to save in.
